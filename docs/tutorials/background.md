### I'm philologist, what to do?

**First case**: Your are about to change your position and apply for technical writing in the near future (*1-2 months*). 

Better to:

  1. During period of time (*you have*), you should be focused on the technical writing requirements when applying for a job. Requirements can be different, because technical writing can be both *unidirectional* and *multi-directional*.
     1. Unidirectional - means that technical writers are only specialized in writing specific texts (*e.g. Chief that cooks only meety meals, other meals - he can not!*)
     2. Multi-directional - means that technical writers are capable of solving different kind of tasks. (*e.g. Handyman or Jack of all trades*)
  2. When you defined precise requirements, you should search for best practises of using such requirements, but only for technical writing, not *coding* or *other stuff*.
  3. Try out best practises and it will undoubtedly give you some experience to cope with technical task(*s*) when interviewing.
  4. Prepare for interview for a trainee or junior position (*technical writer*)

**Another case**: You have enough time for preparation to become a technical writer (*3-6 months*).

The best choice would be to:

  1. Pass some basic courses of using computers, gadgetry and other technical stuff (in case if are not ***confident user***).
     1.  If you have children, I guess would be better to ask them (*at first*)
     2.  If you already have such kind of knowledge and enough practice, you may skip this point and move to the *second*.
  2.  Work on writing skills.
    1. Read any manuals and catch the process of describing things. Manuals can be different, manual of *using washing machine, air conditioner etc*.
    2. Follow industry news (*about technology, gadgetries etc.*)
    3. Practise writing by describing some *step-by-step* (*consecutive*) processes (*e.g. the process of baking cakes*)
    4. In case you have been suggested to work with text (*to work as a copywriter or something looks closer*) for free, feel free and take that task. That is a good chance to try to work with text!
    5. In the long run, give the written manual to anyone to read. Let them estimate you by giving objective feedback.
  3. Get acquainted with popular editors for Texting. There are several prevalent text editors for technical writers: ***SublimeText, VsCode, Notepad++***. (*Google Docs, Word can also be used to learn how to work with hotkeys*)
  4. Take part in quizzes in terms of writing on the keyboard. Fast typing is the key of carrying yourself to the destination (*accomplishing tasks, faster job promotion etc.*) faster

     1. While interviewing, be confident to show your experience in verbal form. That works! You may literally tell the story of how you can organise your work
     2. Take some time to recall and the job is yours!

## IT Engineering

Engineers are often well-educated and experienced in Science Subjects (*math, physics etc.*), just because they may have *other mindset* or they just graduated from *universities with IT directions*.

!!! note

    Try to be sophisticated, because you will learn how to work with a tone of text!


### I'm IT-man, what skills to learn (*philological*)?


IT specialists commonly work with technical subject and they usually do not care about minor details, which are essential for being a technical writer.

There are some tips to be done:

  1. Work on writing skills. As technical writing requires clear and coherent communication. 
      1. Try to write any manuals or meaningful texts (*consecutive texts would be the best choice*). Imagine that you have to explain everything to the kid (*in details*)
      2. While writing, be attentive with *grammar* and *syntax*
      3. Parallely, read the articles and literature suitable for you. The focus is not on the material you read, but for the number of words you will be able to absorb.
      4. Spend as much time as you may afford yourself. The more you spend, the faster you get (*technical writer position*)
   2. Develop soft skills. Originally, philologists likely to have better soft skills than IT specialists (*from my point of view, thoughts based on gained experience*). Some of you may argue, yes, I would admit ur arguments too.
      1. Soft skills will help you not to ruin your first step of interviews with Recruiter or HR.
      2. Work on the manner of communication. You may easily record yourself on the camera and just audio itself, giving simple questions and responding to yourself, and after that replay it and listen. If there is something sounds not trustworthy as you would hear from your interlocutor, then you ought to work on that part of your speech.
   3. Prepare yourself to type the same number of words or even more. As technical writing demands much typing, you should not relax and give up typing by saying "Eventually...". No, that is another experience, but with the same skill.
