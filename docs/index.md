# Welcome to knowledge base for technical writers


## What and why

The purpose of creating current website is to show ***how to become a decent technical writer***. Technical writers can also derive some new ideas or skill there.

!!! note
    
     **Technical writer** - a person that creates technical documentation.




## How we get there

The story began from nothing. I wanted to share shareable data with people interested in **TechWriting** sphere.

##Backstory

I've encountered some trouble situations to become a decent **Tech Writer**, there are some:

* **Enough time to research**. Current case is prevalent among technical writers, due to the tasks coming from their current work. Therefore, the only way is to learn out of work. (_For instance, home_)

* **Misunderstanding field for Head**. As I'm from Uzbekistan, majority of head empoyers are not aware of this field (_technical writing_). Thus, head employers often give inaccurate tasks, which will not be able to lead a technical writer further (*by the carrier path*)

* **Different opinions**. Through the whole internet communities, there are too many misleading Information, which cannot be solved without a decent Technical Writer (_Mentor_). Technical writers can also have wrong opinion, therefore the current website is gonna solve that.
