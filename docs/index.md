# Welcome to knowledge base for technical writers

## Preamble

**Technical writer** - a person that creates technical documentation. 

**Technical documentation** is the source of *learning* and *gaining* information.

Technical documentation may mean different, there are some:

  - Instructions
  - Policies
  - Guides
  - Knowledge Base
  - API Documentation
  - FAQs
  
!!! example

     Not all the  types of technical documentation is counted here, but some counted are heard and seen by all. For instance, **FAQs** - frequently asked questions. I guess at least one out of 10 visitors of current website asked a question whenever some software was not working.

## What and why

The purpose of creating current website is to show 
***how to become a technical writer or what tools can help technical writers to raise higher***. 



     
## How we get there

The story began from nothing. I wanted to share shareable data with people interested in **TechWriting** sphere.

## Backstory

Before as I became a technical writer, I had graduated Tahskent University of Information Technologies (*TUIT*). So, I'm much less philologist, than developer.

I've been working as a technical for about 2+ years. During this period of time I've encountered some trouble situations to become a decent **Tech Writer**, below, some of them are mentioned.

* **Lack of resources to learn**. There was no any directions at universities, courses and other shareable materials to develop as a technical writer in my country. Thus, I must gain skills relying on the sources I had (*some books for writing, some small communities in telegram channels etc.*)
* **Enough time to research**. Current case is prevalent among technical writers, due to the tasks coming from their current work. Therefore, the only way is to learn out of work. (_For instance, home_)

* **Misunderstanding field for Head**. As I'm from Uzbekistan, majority of head empoyers are not aware of this field (_technical writing_). Thus, head employers often give inaccurate tasks, which will not be able to lead a technical writer further (*by the carrier path*)

* **Different opinions**. Through the whole internet communities, there are too many misleading Information, which cannot be solved without a decent Technical Writer (_Mentor_). Technical writers can also have wrong opinion, therefore the current website is gonna solve that.
